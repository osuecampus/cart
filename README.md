# Course AI Resilience Tracker (CART)
> Helping you assess and improve your course's resilience against generative AI tools.

## Description
In response to the clear need for effective integration of generative AI in educational settings, a new tool was developed (as part of a wider suite) to assist faculty in navigating this complex landscape. This tool is designed to support instructors in evaluating how generative AI could respond to their course learning outcomes. It facilitates a detailed understanding of learner profiles to ensure that AI applications are relevant and accessibile to all students. Additionally, the tool encourages faculty to reflect on the currency and relevance of their learning materials and to assess how AI might be incorporated into activities and assignments. By examining existing course policies on AI usage and offering actionable steps for course development, this resource aims to demystify generative AI for both educators and students, promoting a thoughtful and strategic approach to its integration.

The [Course AI Resilience Tracker (CART) Tool](https://beav.es/cart-tool) designed for [Oregon State University Ecampus](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu) helps you to determine various methods of action for your online course.
